    <h1>True 5G Mm Wave</h1>
    <p>The evolution of 5G has progressed smoothly since 3GPP standardized the first release, Release 15, in the middle of 2018. Release 16 was completed in early July 2020. Also, 3GPP 5G spanning Releases 15 and 16 was endorsed as an ITU IMT-2020 5G standard in July 2020. In addition to sub 6GHz spectrum’s effective utilization, Releases 15 and 16 also provide the core functionalities for supporting mmWave technology.

        Previously, the use of frequency bands well above 6 GHz has been considered unsuitable for mobile communications due to high propagation loss and the ease with which signals are blocked by the human body as well as building materials and leaves. While these challenges limit mmWave deployment, new antenna technology allows us to explore different deployment scenarios and better understand channel characteristics and signal propagation.</p>
